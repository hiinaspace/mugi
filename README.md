# MUGI (Mini Udon Game Interface)

> **Work in Progress** - This package is under active development for VRChat Game Jam 2025. APIs and structure may change.

MUGI is a framework for creating multiplayer minigames as prefabs in VRChat worlds. It provides lobby management, game lifecycle handling, scoring systems, and player tracking to simplify the development of 5-minute multiplayer VR experiences.

Originally developed for [VRChat Game Jam 2025](https://jam.vrg.party), MUGI is designed to be reusable for games beyond the jam.

## Features

- **Lobby System** - Join/leave, team selection, game master controls
- **Game Lifecycle** - Automated state management (Lobby → Countdown → Running → Ending)
- **Scoring & Teams** - Built-in score tracking and team management
- **VRChat Networking** - Synchronized multiplayer state
- **Prefab-Based** - Games as portable prefabs that can be placed at origin
- **Callback System** - Hook into game events without modifying core logic

## Quick Start

### Installation

TODO add the weird VCC manifest thing

### Basic Usage

1. Create a Prefab Variant of the `MugiGame` prefab
2. Add your game objects as children
3. Configure min/max players and teams in the MugiController
4. Set up callback UdonBehaviours to respond to game events
5. Use `MugiController.IncrementScore()` and other methods in your game logic

## Package Contents

### Core Prefabs
- **MugiGame** - Main game controller prefab (create variants of this)
- **MugiLobbyUI** - Default lobby interface
- **MugiScoreboard** - Score display and timer
- **MugiPlayerObject** - Per-player tracking object

### Scripts
- **MugiGame (Controller)** - Main game logic and networking
- **MugiLobbyUI** - Lobby interface controller  
- **MugiScoreboard** - Score and timer display
- **MugiPlayerObject** - Individual player state

## Game Lifecycle

*Documentation in progress*

States: Lobby → Countdown → Running → Ending/Aborted → (back to Lobby)

## Callback System

*Documentation in progress*

Available callbacks:
- `OnMugiCountdown` - Game starting countdown
- `OnMugiStart` - Game begins
- `OnMugiEnd` - Game finished
- `OnMugiPlayerJoin` - Player joins
- `OnMugiPlayerLeave` - Player leaves
- `OnMugiTimeWarning` - Time running out

## Networking & Synchronization  

*Documentation in progress*

- Score synchronization
- Late joiner handling

## Technical Requirements

- **Space**: Designed for 20m × 20m × 20m game areas
- **Players**: 2-8 simultaneous players
- **Duration**: 5-minute maximum game time
- **VRChat SDK**: Worlds 3.8.x+
- **Unity**: 2022.3+

## Development Status

This package is being actively developed for VRChat Game Jam 2025. Current focus areas:

- [ ] Core MugiController implementation
- [ ] UI system completion
- [ ] Networking synchronization
- [ ] Example game implementations
- [ ] Documentation and samples
